This is because smaller classes can be recognized/accepted/generated by simpler mechanisms (automata, grammars, regular expressions, etc.), which is desirable.</p>\n\n<p>For example, the class of regular languages has <em>good</em> closure properties, and given a DFA $\\mathcal{A}$ you can test in linear time that a word belongs to $L(\\mathcal{A})$. In contrast, with a Turing machine you need linear time just to read the output, which usually happens <strong>before</strong> it actually starts processing.</p>\n\n<p>In short, for smaller classes you need less computational power to solve the problem of deciding whether a word belongs to the language.</p>\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-sensitive_grammar\">Wikipedia</a>, Chomsky defined context-sensitive grammars (i.e. Type 1) to describe the syntax of natural languages. This is a bit different than with other classes of languages, which were introduced to describe families of strings that were used in mathematics (e.g. the syntax of arithmetic formulae) instead of natural languages (e.g. the syntax of a gramatically-correct sentence in English).</p>\n", "OwnerUserId": "24", "LastActivityDate": "2012-03-06T21:08:39.040", "CommentCount": "2","Relevance":"[2,2,2]"}}
